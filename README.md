# ValentinesDayApp
A sample Android application that makes a slide-show while playing an audio.

The application retrieves the slide-show images and the audio file from the assests folder. It runs an additional thread for making the slide-show.

The original repo is [here](https://github.com/erkutdemirhan/ValentinesDayApp). I made some modifications to it.
